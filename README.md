Hi 👋 I’m Bhuvan Shah
====================

Software Engineer | ML-Driven Systems | Distributed Backend  
Los Angeles, California

I’m a USC MSCS graduate and Software Development Engineer with strong backend and ML foundations. I build production-grade systems where **data pipelines, APIs, and ML models meet reliability and scale**. My work spans real-time telemetry, distributed systems, NLP, and cloud-native ML infrastructure.

I care about correctness, performance, and systems that don’t fall apart under load.

**Currently open to New Grad / Early-Career SWE and SWE-ML roles (US).**

### Experience Snapshot

**Software Development Engineer — Easley Dunn Productions**  
- Built and optimized real-time telemetry and data ingestion pipelines across 5 distributed systems  
- Reduced ingestion latency by ~60% through schema validation, query tuning, and concurrency optimization  
- Optimized C++ and PostgreSQL hot paths, cutting memory usage and query latency from seconds to sub-100ms  

**Graduate Teaching Assistant — University of Southern California**  
- Mentored 360+ students in backend design, ML pipelines, and production debugging  
- Designed real-world simulation labs covering streaming data, ETL, and ML evaluation  

**Data Scientist Intern — Prompt Softech**  
- Deployed LSTM-based trading models with 93% accuracy  
- Built scalable ML pipelines combining market data and NLP-based sentiment
